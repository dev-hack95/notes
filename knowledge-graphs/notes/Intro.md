# Knowledge Graphs

  * **Intoduction**

    * Knowledge graphs are structured representation of knowledge, organising data from multiple sources
      and capturing information about entities of interest and relationships b/w them. They serve as
      foundation for data integration, enhanced AI techniques and improved human system interaction



    * **Key Components**

      * A knowledge graphs consist of three primary components

        1) **Nodes** : Nodes represents entities which can be physical or abstract objects

        2) **Edges** : Defines relation or connections b/w the nodes, illustrting how entities are connected

        3) **Attributes** : Provide additional information or properties for both nodes and edges, offering
           contetxt and details about each entity in relationship


    * **How knowledge graph works**

      * Knowledge graphs operate by organizing  and linking data points (entities) through relationships
        extracting information about these entities and their relationship form the data itself


        1) **Defining Entities (Nodes)** : Identifying the main concepts or items within dataset

        2) **Establishing Relationships (Edges)** : Connecting entities to illustrate their relationships

        3) **Applying Schema/Ontology** : Maintaining uniformly across the graph using defines schema or
           ontology

        4) **Enriching with properties/attributes** :


    * **Structure of a Knowledge Graph**
      * A knowledge graph highlights the interconnections between data points, emphasizing the relationships between them1. Structuring a knowledge graph involves these typical steps1:

        1) Defining entities or nodes to represent key concepts or items in  the dataset.

        2) Establishing relationships or edges to connect these entities.

        3) Applying a schema or ontology to ensure uniformity across the graph.

        4) Enriching the graph with properties and attributes for context.

        5) Validating the graph through testing and refinement1.

    * **Characteristics of Knowledge Graphs**
      * Graphs: Organized as a graph where nodes (entities and types), relationships, and attributes are equally important, facilitating easy integration of new datasets and exploration through links2.

      * Semantic: Encodes the meaning of data in an ontology, describing entity types and characteristics, enabling reasoning and derivation of new information2.

      * Alive: Flexible in supporting various data types and schemas, evolving to reflect domain changes and incorporating new data2.

    * **Construction and Maintenance**
      * Creating and maintaining knowledge graphs involves complex processes of manual and automatic modeling and data ingestion. Ensuring information remains up-to-date, consistent, and trustworthy requires specialized methods, including2:
